## üèóÔ∏è Repository Setup

### Initial Repository Configuration

1. **Repository Settings**
   - Enable Issues and Discussions
   - Set up branch protection rules
   - Configure required status checks
   - Enable automatic deletion of merged branches

2. **Branch Protection Rules**
   ```
   Branch: main
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up to date before merging
   - Include administrators
   - Restrict pushes that create files
   ```

3. **Required Status Checks**
   - `test-backend`
   - `test-frontend`
   - `test-integration`
   - `security-scan`

### Repository Labels

Create the following labels for issue categorization:

#### Type Labels
- `bug` - Something isn't working
- `enhancement` - New feature or request
- `documentation` - Improvements or additions to documentation
- `good first issue` - Good for newcomers
- `help wanted` - Extra attention is needed

#### Priority Labels
- `priority: high` - High priority issues
- `priority: medium` - Medium priority issues
- `priority: low` - Low priority issues

#### Status Labels
- `status: in progress` - Currently being worked on
- `status: blocked` - Blocked by external factors
- `status: needs review` - Ready for review
- `status: ready for testing` - Ready for QA testing

#### Epic Labels
- `epic: foundation` - Core infrastructure
- `epic: document-management` - Document handling features
- `epic: ai-analysis` - AI-powered features
- `epic: collaboration` - Real-time collaboration
